Option A: Technical/Architectural
  A sleek technical diagram showing signal flow between connected virtual machines.
  Minimalist design with dark background (#0d1117). Three rounded rectangular nodes
  labeled "parser", "fetcher", "renderer" connected by glowing animated signal paths.
  Signals shown as small bright dots traveling along the paths. Each node has input
  ports on the left (blue) and output ports on the right (green). Inside each node,
  a subtle queue visualization. Modern monospace typography. Inspired by circuit
  board aesthetics meets modern UI design. No gradients, flat colors, high contrast.

  Option B: Abstract/Artistic
  Abstract visualization of message passing between autonomous systems. Three floating
  cubes in isometric view, connected by streams of glowing particles. Each cube is
  semi-transparent showing an inner mechanism - a spiral queue. Particles flow from
  cube to cube, changing color as they pass through each one (blue → green → orange).
  Dark void background with subtle grid. Style: minimalist 3D render, soft shadows,
  neon accents. Mood: calm, precise, technological.

  Option C: Infographic/Explainer
  Clean infographic explaining "Blocks as VMs". Split into 3 horizontal sections:

  TOP: Single block shown as a box with "in" arrow on left, "out" arrow on right,
  internal queue shown as stacked cards.

  MIDDLE: Two blocks connected by a wire, signal (bright dot) traveling between them.

  BOTTOM: Three blocks composed into a larger container block, internal wiring visible.

  Style: Figma/Linear design system aesthetic. White background, black lines,
  accent color #6366f1. Sans-serif labels. Generous whitespace.

  Option D: Motion/Flow focused
  Visualization of reactive data flow. Dark canvas. Multiple hexagonal nodes arranged
  in a network. Bright signal pulses originate from one node and cascade through the
  network - each node lights up momentarily as the signal passes through, then emits
  its own signals to connected nodes. Trails show the path taken. Color palette:
  deep purple background, cyan signals, white node outlines. Style: like a neural
  network visualization but more geometric and orderly.

  Which vibe fits? Or I can combine elements. The key concepts to visualize:
  1. Blocks as isolated units (boxes/nodes with boundaries)
  2. Signals as moving messages (dots/particles traveling)
  3. Wires as connections (lines/paths between blocks)
  4. Queue inside each block (the pending signals)
  5. Composition (blocks inside blocks)
