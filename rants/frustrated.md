i keep going around in circles it seems.
i'm not sure how to move forward.

i guess the best way to describe the problem is
"i have all these requirements
and i don't know how to
lay them all out in front of me
so i can see the problem in it's entirety".

let's just blert it out without trying to
make sense. here goes.

i'm trying to build this library
or an approach or something
that allows me to build things up into
separable units
that i can test separately
and that can communicate over any medium
and allow for connecting effects together...

connecting effects together ...

you see, the core of auto is tying variables
to other variables, it was inverting functions,
it was ...

you know, a variable changes. and then?
well that means this variable should change...

so the function in that sense is a set of instructions
for how to build a variable. and the whole point was
to automatically re-build the variable ...

ok so now i have this other thing
where i have an event
like an http request
or even just a mouse click
and it does not fit properly into the paradyme
and i can't wrap my head around why -
i can't seem to grok
why what i've built
just doesn't work in that instance
and i don't know how to conceptualise all this
in order to clarify what is not fitting ...

ok, and the _other_ thing that is really bumming me out
is my codebase is just a mess - it's just lots and lots of files
and i can't see a way to clean it up.
i can't even see a way to ... figure out what a 'clean' version
might look like - what 'clean' even means in this case ...

i have a sense that what i want is clarity, or ease of access,
being able to quickly ... having things ... sort of all work
properly, not having to worry about everything, about ...
maybe `locality` is a good word here, having confidence that
everything outside is simply outside ...

which i guess one could solve with all the type craziness that
the functional peeps talk so much about ...

but it's not just that - i don't just want to know that 'what i
need to do here is just this and this' and not have to worry
about what madness is happening outside

> which is a _great_ criticism for CSS - you have ZERO idea what
> context you are working in!!
