# devlog

as i write i basically blog about all my thoughts
and whenever i make a significant change i increment
the file number with like `021_subscriptions.js`.
then in the `tests/` folder there is a script
called `runall.js` which takes this latest version
(just looks at the number) and copies it over
all the main library files i.e. `auto_...js`.

in `src` are these javascript files and corresponding
notes are in `docs`.

i use to have just one huge file which is now called
`old.md`. it has the start of the development, from
the blank page so to speak. it's a good place to go
if you want to understand the thinking behind all this
(though i don't expect many would be that interested).
