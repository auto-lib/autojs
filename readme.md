**auto** is a simple, robust and explainable
reactivity library.

## simple

the entire **auto** library is 100 lines long,
has no external dependencies and uses five variables
to manage its internal state. for a detailed
explanation of how everything works see
[docs/internals.md](docs/internals.md).

## robust

each of these are flat structures. the dependencies
of `get count()` in the example above are in an array
in `dep.count`. similarly for whether `count` needs
to be re-calculated (`dirty.count`) and what the
last calculated value is (`value.count`). all these
structures sit outside of the functions that change
things. these are the three methods internally in
the **auto** library:

 - `update(tag)` update the value of variable named `tag` (here we use `tag` and not `name` because of autorun blocks. see below)
 - `getter(tag)` get the value of `tag`, updating if dirty. if `running` is set, add to `running`s dependencies
 - `setter(tag,value)` put `val` into `tag`, updating / making dirty each dependency as needed


## explainable

this makes it trivial to understand what is happening
at any point in time: simply print out the `_` member
of the returned _auto_ object.

```js
console.log($._);
```

> {
>     dep: ['count': ['data'], 'msg': ['data','count']],
>     dirty: { msg: true },
>     value: { data: [1,2,3], count: 3 }
> }

(We leave out `running` and `fns` since they are not useful to see).

Notice how we can tell directly what is happening: what depends
on what, what will be updated on next access, and what the values
are now. This is the core of reactivity and `auto` makes these
explicit.

### npm

to use via npm install with `npm install @autolib/auto`
and then in `test.js` put

```js
const auto = require('@autolib/auto');

let $ = auto({
    data: null,
    get count() { if (this.data) return data.length; else return 0; }
    get msg() { return "Found "+this.count()+" entries" }
})

console.log($._);
```

Now running `node test.js` you should see

```
c:\Users\karlp\test-auto>node test.js
{ deps: {}, dirty: { count: true, msg: true }, value: {} }
```

### es6 module

to use as an es6 module
change the last line of the library
(`auto.js`) from `module.exports = auto;` to
`export default auto;`. Then you can import it like
this:

```js
const auto = import('auto.js');
```

it should then work as before.

### browser

to use directly in a browser
remove the last line of the
lib (`auto.js`). see `tests/auto-no-export.js`
and `tests/test.html`, which looks like

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>auto test</title>

<script src="auto-no-export.js"></script>

</head>

<body>

  <script>
    let $ = auto({
        data: null,
        count: ($) => $.data ? $.data.length : 0,
        msg: ($) => "Got " + $.count + " items"
    })

    console.log($._);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

just run `npx http-server` from the root folder
and then browse to `http://localhost:8080/tests/test.html`
and you should see `Object { deps: {}, dirty: {â€¦}, value: {} }`
printed to the console.

## development

this library started as an attempt to create MobX-like observables
in Svelte. this was based largely on a video by MobX's creator.
see the [old readme](docs/old-readme.md) for more. then a new
approach was started and written from scratch in a day which
was documented in [extreme detail](docs/devlog).
